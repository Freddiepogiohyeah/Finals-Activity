        <div class="content-box">
            <p>I am Freddie C. Visaya, a 22-year-old aspiring IT professional from Mamaga, Balili, La Trinidad, Benguet. My roots trace back to Balakbak, Kapangan, Benguet. Although I did not grow up there, I take pride in carrying the admirable traits of an e-Kapangan, which is being taraki.</p>
            <p>The reason I chose IT as my course is because honestly, it wasn’t my original choice. I was supposed to take Criminology, but my sister said that course wasn’t really for me, so I ended up taking IT instead. Still, I'm actually enjoying it now and I’ve learned a lot so far.</p>
            <p>My goal in life is to become successful not just for myself, but so I can achieve financial stability and provide for my family. I want to build a secure future where I can be independent and give back to those who have always supported me.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>My hobbies include hanging out with my friends whenever we have free time at school. Besides that, I also enjoy riding bicycles. For me, cycling is not only a good exercise but also provides me with a sense of freedom and helps clear my mind, and also contributing to my mental well-being. Lastly, I also love playing computer games, particularly League of Legends. Engaging in strategic gameplay and teamwork within the game allows me to focus and relax, which helps me stay calm and unwind after a long day.</p>
